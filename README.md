# Chatter

simple chat bot in a custom element

# Assignment 1

Think of your own reluctance to install a new app on your phone as well as your possible preference for texting rather than calling someone up. We will build a simple SMS chat bot that uses the basic building blocks of javascript, sequence, selection, iteration, arrays, dictionaries and objects. The chatbot will allow you to order your favourite takeout dishes from your dream restaurant via SMS. There is a scaffold for the code with Jasmine tests here.

You need to have at least 2 items on the menu. The menu items need to have size and one other attribute like toppings. You also need an up-sell item like drinks in the example.

## Marking

- basic order for an item in a zip (6)
- 2nd or 3rd item (2)
- up-sell item (2)
